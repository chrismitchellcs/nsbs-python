Older NSBS website using Python Flask.

Uses Beautiful Soup 4 (HTML scraping library) to get buysell data from a MTB buysell website called Pinkbike.  This allowed employees to upload bikes to the buysell on pinkbike, and the bikes would shop up on the website.  The scraping only needed one request from pinkbike as well so it does not affect them.

Currently being hosted on Heroku but will be taken down soon as we are paying for it.
